# Ask me anything!

Hi! I'm Kat! I'm a software dev who likes writing all sorts of random little libraries for fun in a variety of languages. I really enjoy Programming Language Theory, Lisp-related stuff, unix/linux, distributed programming, frontend webapp stuff, devops, community management, and making the tech industry a place where a bigger variety of people can find opportunity and success. I'm a Puerto Rican genderqueer woman, a polyglot, and I like talking about myself.

These days, I'm an engineer on the [`npm` CLI](https://npmjs.org), an admin for [LGBTQ in Technology](http://lgbtq.technology), founder and admin for [WeAllJS](http://wealljs.org), I have a [Twitter brand](https://twitter.com/maybekatz), and I [give talks about tech stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th5yEUtXsQc), and they tend to be about JavaScript, Node.js, and npm.

I figured it might be fun to open myself up for general questions, so I went ahead and forked this repo! You can ask me literally anything here.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Gay (as in queer) shit. Whatever.
